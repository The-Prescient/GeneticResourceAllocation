# Genetic Resource Allocation Project

Approach to solve a resource allocation problem using Genetic Evolutionary concepts into an algorithm (GA).

The project has two parts:

1. Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm from scratch and algorithm performance evaluation.
2. A comprehensive report detailing the process and evaluation outcomes.

Dataset used for the testing and evaluation is not shared due to privacy nontheless the comprehensive report discussess the data requirements.
